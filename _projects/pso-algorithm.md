In the third year of college, I took a course on optimization methods. Initially, it was just a series of mathematical techniques and exercises, nothing too remarkable. However, things took a turn when we reached evolutionary optimization algorithms. Now that was something that grabbed my attention! It was clear that this was also the professor’s favorite topic; he delivered an incredible lecture full of fascinating examples. At that time, I was quite inspired by him, and his enthusiasm ignited a significant passion in me. I don’t think I’ve ever been so inspired by a professor before.

I started my research on evolutionary algorithms, focusing particularly on particle swarm optimization. I read numerous articles and watched several online videos about the topic. My exploration led me to experiment with a custom method of my own. I aimed to illustrate how particles move in space and how the optimal result is selected through the optimization process. As a result, I developed a [website]({{page.website}}) where anyone can perform an optimization process in their browser for a given mathematical function.
