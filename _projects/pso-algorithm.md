In the third year of college I took optimization methods classes. At first it wasn't anything spectacular, a bunch of mathematical methods with a lot of exercises. Halfway through the semester we got to the evolutional optimization algorithms. Now that was something that grabbed my attention! I noticed it was the professor's favorite topic aswell, he prepared an amazing speech with interesting examples. I was quite literally infatuated with the professor at the time and it ignited a big fire in me. I don't think I have ever been that inspired by a professor before.

So I started my research on evolutional algorithms, mainly the particle swarm optimization method. I read a bunch of articles and watched a dozen of online videos about the topic. As a result I started experimenting with a custom method of my own. I wanted to showcase how those particles move in space and which particle is chosen as the result of the optimization. Eventually I made a website (link in the details of the post) where everybody can execute an optimization process in their browser for a given mathematical function.
