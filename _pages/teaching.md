During my undergraduate university studies I got an opportunity to teach my fellow students, in fact I was an assistant to the teaching assistant. Sort of like a teaching fellow. During the whole semester, I was at the disposal of the students especially when they had interesting questions. I was an assistant teaching fellow for one semester in the subject of Computer Architecture. During those classes the students did programming exercises in the assembly programming language. *Ouch!*

*The crux of the matter*: you gotta learn your C programming course real well before stepping into Computer Architecture territory!

Later in my master studies I was a teaching assistant in database related subjects: relational databases, non-relational databases, object-oriented programming with database elements, database design, database normalization, data organization. This adventure lasted 2 semesters: 1 semester as online courses and 1 semester in-person courses. Naturally I'm a shy person who doesn't like to perform in front of masses, so starting with the online courses was the perfect hit. In-person courses were more challenging to teach but at the same time they were more interesting, too. Being a teaching assistant not only gave me the opportunity to teach and check the students' knowledge but I learnt a lot about the process of teaching itself.

Teaching is knowledge sharing, answering questions, listening and debating. But teaching is also preparing study materials and tests, utilizing the tools used for teaching (projector, smart board, PCs/laptops, printers, copy machines) and keeping your sh*t together in front of hundreds of students.

*The crux of the matter*: the teaching assistant doesn't want to let you down.
