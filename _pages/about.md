My name is Gergelj Kiš and I'm from Novi Sad, Serbia.

Although I currently work as a data engineer, I’ve always considered myself a creator at heart. My journey into the digital world began at a young age with a deep passion for creating — whether it was touching up photos, mixing music, or later editing videos. This early love for digital creation naturally led me to study multimedia throughout high school, allowing me to immerse myself in the creative process.

When I entered university, I decided to push my boundaries and explore something new: programming. I delved into the world of code, developing various applications and gaining insights at the intersection of information technology and mathematics. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I enjoyed solving problems and building things from the ground up, which eventually guided me towards a career in data engineering.

Even though my work now centers around data, I still carry that creative spark into everything I do. For me, the technical and the creative aren’t separate; they’re two sides of the same coin, and I’m always seeking ways to integrate them into my work.

Just like this website.
