Hello there, digital visitor! Welcome to my website!

My name is Gergelj Kiš, and while I’m currently working as a data engineer, I’ve always seen myself as a creator at heart. My journey into the digital world started at a very young age with a deep passion for creating things — whether it was touching up photos, mixing music or later editing videos. This early love for digital creation naturally led me to study multimedia throughout high school, where I could immerse myself in the creative process.

When I entered university, I decided to push my boundaries and challenge myself with something new — programming. I dove into the world of code, developing a variety of applications and learning many new things at the intersection of information technology and maths. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I enjoyed solving problems and building things from the ground up, which eventually led me to a career in data engineering.

Even though my work now revolves around data, I still carry that creative spark with me in everything I do. For me, the technical and the creative aren’t separate; they’re two sides of the same coin, and I’m always looking for ways to bring them together in my work.

Just like this website.
